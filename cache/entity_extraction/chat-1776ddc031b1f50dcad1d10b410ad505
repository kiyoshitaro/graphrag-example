In other words, nodes in the network need a way to fix some 'point' in a multichain state and reach a consensus about that state. In TON, a special chain called MasterChain is used for that purpose. Blocks of masterchain contain additional information (latest block hashes) about all other chains in the system, thus any observer unambiguously determines the state of all multichain systems at a single masterchain block.\n\n\nSmart Contract Addresses\nThis section will describe the specifics of smart contract addresses on TON Blockchain. It will also explain how actors are synonymous with smart contracts on TON.\n\nEverything is a Smart Contract\nOn TON, smart contracts are built using the Actor model. In fact, actors in TON are technically represented as smart contracts. This means that even your wallet is a simple actor (and a smart contract).\n\nTypically, actors process incoming messages, change their internal state, and generate outbound messages as a result. That's why every actor (i.e., smart contract) on TON Blockchain must have an address, so it is able to receive messages from other actors.\n\n:::info EVM EXPERIENCE On the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), addresses are completely separate from smart contracts.
