It is common practice for wallets, when sending coins to non-initialized addresses, to send coins to both bounceable and non-bounceable addresses without return.\n\nIf there is a need to quickly get an address in bounceable/non-bounceable form this can be done here.\n\nResponsibility for custom products\nIf you are developing a custom product on the TON blockchain, it is essential to implement similar checks and logic:\n\nEnsure your application verifies whether the recipient address is initialized before sending funds. Based on the address state, use bounceable addresses for user smart contracts with custom application logic to ensure funds are returned. Use non-bounceable addresses for wallets.\n\n\n\nCells as Data Storage\nEverything in TON is stored in cells. A cell is a data structure containing:\n\nup to 1023 bits of data (not bytes!)\nup to 4 references to other cells\nBits and references are not intermixed (they are stored separately). Circular references are forbidden: for any cell, none of its descendant cells can have this original cell as reference.\n\nThus, all cells constitute a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Here is a good picture to illustrate:\n\nDirected Acylic Graph\n\nCell types\nCurrently, there are 5 types of cell: ordinary and 4 exotic.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
