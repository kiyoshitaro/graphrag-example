A good example is to make a workchain that works on the base of EVM to run Solidity smart contracts on it.\n\nTheoretically, everyone in community can create own workchain. In fact, it's pretty complicated task to build it, after that to pay (expensive) price of creating it and receive 2/3 of votes from validators to approve creation of your Workchain.\n\nTON allows creating up to 2^32 workchains, each subdivided to up to 2^60 shards.\n\nNowadays, there are only 2 workchains in TON: MasterChain and BaseChain.\n\nBaseChain is used for everyday transactions between actors because it's pretty cheap, while MasterChain have a crucial function for TON, so let's cover what does it do!\n\nMasterchain: Blockchain of Blockchains\nThere is a necessity for the synchronization of message routing and transaction execution. In other words, nodes in the network need a way to fix some 'point' in a multichain state and reach a consensus about that state. In TON, a special chain called MasterChain is used for that purpose. Blocks of masterchain contain additional information (latest block hashes) about all other chains in the system, thus any observer unambiguously determines the state of all multichain systems at a single masterchain block.\n\n\nSmart Contract Addresses\nThis\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
