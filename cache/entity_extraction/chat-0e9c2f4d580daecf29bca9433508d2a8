Feel free to learn more about the differences by reading our article \"Six unique aspects of TON Blockchain that will surprise Solidity developers\" by Tal Kol. :::\n\nAddress of Smart Contract\nSmart contract addresses operating on TON typically consist of two main components:\n\n(workchain_id): denotes the workchain ID (a signed 32-bit integer)\n\n(account_id) denotes the address of the account (64-512 bits, depending on the workchain)\n\nIn the raw address overview section of this documentation, we'll discuss how (workchain_id, account_id) pairs present themselves.\n\nWorkchain ID and Account ID\nWorkchain ID\nAs we've seen before, it is possible to create as many as 2^32 workchains operating on TON Blockchain. We also noted how 32-bit prefix smart contract addresses identify and are linked to smart contract addresses within different workchains. This allows smart contracts to send and receive messages to and from different workchains on TON Blockchain.\n\nNowadays, only the Masterchain (workchain_id=-1) and occasionally the basic workchain (workchain_id=0) are running in TON Blockchain.\n\nBoth of them have 256-bit addresses, therefore, we assume that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
