{"result": "TVM, standing for TON Virtual Machine, is a computational architecture designed to execute the bytecode of smart contracts within the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain. It utilizes a special cell flavor for containing op-codes, which are the instructions necessary for the execution of these smart contracts.
