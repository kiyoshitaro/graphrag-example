{"result": "A smart contract is a digital protocol designed to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, enabling the execution of credible transactions without the need for third parties. Specifically, within the TON blockchain, a smart contract is characterized as an actor with its own storage and behavior, capable of responding to events, modifying properties, and generating messages. These programs execute on the blockchain, managing transactions and the initialization of wallets, and are essential for the coordination of nodes to achieve consensus on the contract's state. Each smart contract on the TON Blockchain is identified by a unique address, which is composed of a workchain ID and an account ID. Essentially, smart contracts are coded agreements that automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, playing a crucial role in handling transactions and implementing custom application logic on the blockchain.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
