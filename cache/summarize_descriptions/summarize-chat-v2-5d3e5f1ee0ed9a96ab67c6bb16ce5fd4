{"result": "The Account ID is a unique identifier for accounts on the TON blockchain, which is determined by hashing the initial code and state of a smart contract. It serves as a unique identifier within a workchain, consisting of a 256-bit address. This concept applies to both the Masterchain and Basechain, where 256-bit addresses are used for identifying smart contract objects on the TON Blockchain. Essentially, the Account ID plays a crucial role in ensuring that each account, whether it is part of the Masterchain, Basechain, or any workchain, is uniquely identified through a standardized process involving a 256-bit address generated from the account's initial code and state.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
