This supernatural figure appears to Scrooge, prompting him to reflect on his past and showing him visions that deeply affect his current state and outlook on life. The Ghost confronts Scrooge with his own earlier words, urging him to reconsider his views on life, death, and the intrinsic value of every individual. It guides Scrooge on a journey through various scenes related to Christmas, including significant moments from his past such as his time at Fezziwig's warehouse, aiming to induce a change in Scrooge's behavior and perspective towards life.\n\nRepresenting the Future, the Ghost is depicted as both a joyful and generous spirit, spreading mirth and warmth, particularly around Christmas time, and as a spectral figure capable of agitating its surroundings, interacting with Scrooge in ways that induce fear and deliver poignant messages.
