{"result": "Workchain and Shardchains are integral components of the TON network, showcasing a symbiotic relationship that enhances the network's functionality and customization. Shardchains possess the capability to be customized into a Workchain, specifically to run certain smart contracts, indicating a functional relationship between the two. This customization allows Workchains to establish specific rules within Shardchains, demonstrating their pivotal role in tailoring the network's operations to meet diverse needs. Together, Workchain and Shardchains contribute to the adaptability and efficiency of the TON network by enabling a customizable framework for executing smart contracts.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
