{"result": "Base64url is a URL-safe variant of Base64 encoding, specifically designed to be safe for use in URLs and filenames. It achieves this by using '_' (underscore) and '-' (dash) instead of '/' (slash) and '+' (plus), which are characters used in standard Base64 encoding but can have special meanings in URLs and filesystem paths. This encoding method is utilized for converting raw addresses, such as those of smart contracts like the 'Test Giver', into a more user-friendly address form. While it shares similarities with Base64 in terms of its purpose and method of encoding, the slight differences in character selection make Base64url uniquely suited for web and file system applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
