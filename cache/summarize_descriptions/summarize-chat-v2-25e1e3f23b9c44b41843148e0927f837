This spirit, known for its genial face, sparkling eye, and joyful air, is adorned in a deep green robe and a holly wreath, symbolizing the joy and goodwill of Christmas. The Ghost plays a crucial role in Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation by showing him various scenes of the holiday, including the bustling streets filled with people celebrating, and intimate gatherings that reveal the warmth and love shared among families and friends. Through these experiences, the Ghost imparts wisdom and encourages Scrooge to change his perspective on life, highlighting the importance of compassion and community. The Ghost of Christmas Present possesses a deep knowledge of the events occurring during the Christmas celebration, such as the game of blind man's-buff, and is even suggested to be aware of the collusion between Topper and Scrooge's nephew in the game.
