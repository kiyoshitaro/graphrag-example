It is a time marked by contrasting emotions and actions. On one hand, it is a period of celebration, joyfully anticipated by characters like Fezziwig, who decides to cease work and commence festivities, highlighting the day's importance and the warmth it brings to the hearts of those who embrace its spirit. This decision to halt work and celebrate is echoed in the narrative, underscoring Christmas Eve as a moment of joy and communal happiness. On the other hand, the day is also described through the lens of cold, bleak weather, reflecting the initial state of Scrooge's heart and his busy, miserly demeanor in his counting-house. Despite the festive spirit that envelops the city, Scrooge remains aloof and engrossed in his work, contrasting sharply with the celebratory mood that Fezziwig and others like Bob Cratchit, who looks forward to the office closing early, embody.
