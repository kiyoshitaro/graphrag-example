Despite its vibrancy and the cold, foggy weather that adds to its character, The City also undergoes a transformation in the story, transitioning from this familiar urban landscape to a more open, rural setting, indicating a departure from the norm and symbolizing a journey beyond Scrooge's usual comfort zone. This transition suggests a vanishing of The City from the immediate narrative, highlighting a shift from the crowded paths of life that Scrooge is accustomed to navigating.

This journey through The City is not just a physical traversal but a symbolic journey into Scrooge's past, revealing the roots of his character and his preferences for solitude, darkness, and the cold, bleak weather that The City often embodies.\n\nThe Phantom further deepens this connection by bringing Scrooge to the heart of The City, emphasizing the pivotal role this location plays in his introspective journey.
